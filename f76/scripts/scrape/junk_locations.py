# Now I want to write a script that's a bit different

"""
We know that each junk item has a URL associated with it:

.44 Casing - URL: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.44_casing

On each of these pages there is a "Locations" section 

For this ex:

- One at Harper's Ferry (<-- link on Harper's ferry)

Since we have a Locations table we should be able to look it up by name, or by the URL
Each listed location seems to link back to it's "location page"

Then we would create a table like item_scraps - but for items in a location 

I think it's not always a set number like "One" 

Sometimes we get:
- Two can be found inside the Orwell Orchards bomb shelter:
 - One can be found inside the bedroom bathroom.
 - One can be found in the kitchen area.

Or:

- Over twenty can be found at the soapy skeleton due south of New River Gorge Bridge - East, underneath a pylon by the railroad tracks.
