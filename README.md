## Fallout Scrapper

A personal Fallout 76 scrap reference. Created to support my own in-game role-play and trading: I'm a wasteland junk seller, and I wanted a fast, offline way to answer "What can I scrap for Lead?" without clicking through wiki pages and scanning long tables.

---

### Why I Built This

If you trade in scrap you know:

- It's a constant struggle to know what's worth picking up, scrapping, or selling
- Online wikis are great, but they're slow to search and usually have a lot of data on one page
- I wanted a personal, queryable database to check "items ‚Üí components" or "components -> items" quickly

This project:

- Scrapes the Fallout 76 [Nukapedia Fallout Wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_junk_items) specifically
- Stores the data found on the Junk Items table in 3 normalize tables:
  - `item` - all the junk items in the game
  - `component` - all scrap components
  - `item_scraps` - the mapping (item ‚Üí component(s), with quantity)

#### Why store queries in SQL files

This project is also part of my personal SQL learning journey.

I‚Äôm keeping **SQL query files** in `sql/` because:

- **Practice** ‚Äî building a library of joins, groupings, and filters on a real dataset.
- **Documentation** ‚Äî each query tells a ‚Äústory‚Äù about how I solved a lookup problem.
- **Reusability** ‚Äî I can run them anytime without rewriting in the CLI.
- **Learning joins** ‚Äî the schema forces me to join `item` ‚Üî `item_scraps` ‚Üî `component` for nearly every question.

### Where this is Going

The plan is to evolve this into a **cross-platform CLI tool** that:

- Lets me run lookups from the terminal:

```bash
scrapper items-for Lead
scrapper components-of "Acoustic Guitar"
```

- Works offline once the data is scraped.
- Can refresh the database on demand with a `scrape` command.
- Is installable via `pipx` on Mac, Windows, or Linux.
- Plans to add scrap from the other fallout games, and allow switching between datasets

#### Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Scraper** ‚Äî fetches and parses the wiki‚Äôs junk items table into SQLite.
- ‚úÖ **Schema** ‚Äî normalized tables for clean joins and queries.
- ‚úÖ **Basic queries** ‚Äî `.sql` files in `sql/` for common lookups.
- ‚úÖ **CLI tool** ‚Äî using Typer for commands.
- üöß **Intermediate/Advanced queries** - todo - LEFT JOIN? No problem, once we refresh some basics let's get our hands dirty with:
  - Left Joins
  - Self Joins
  - Aggregate functions
  - Common Table Expressions
  - Co-occurence analysis
  - Ranking & window function

### CLI Setup & Usage

The Fallout 76 scrap lookup tool now includes a command-line interface powered by [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).

#### Install locally

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fallout76-scrapper.git
cd fallout76-scrapper
```

2. Create virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### First-time setup

Run the `init` function to begin, this will populate your local database:

```bash
f76 init
```

By default, the database will be stored at:

- `data/fallout.sqlite` (if running from repo)
- `~/.local/share/f76/fallout.sqlite` (if installed globally)

#### Commands

Input for each command is case insensitive.

1. Show components from an item

```bash
f76 components-of "Acoustic Guitar"
```

Example output:
| Component | Qty |
|-----------|-----|
| Wood | 4 |
| Steel | 2 |

2. Show items for a component

```bash
f76 items-for "cloth"
```

Lists items sorted by the amount of the component they yield.

Example output:
| Item | Qty |
|-----------|-----|
| Cigar Box | 2 |
| Bumblebear| 1 |
